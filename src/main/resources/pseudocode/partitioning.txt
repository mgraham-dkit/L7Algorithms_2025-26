Action: Partition an array - group all data less than or equal to pivot value on left,
    all other elements (greater than pivot) appear on right
Input: An array of elements (data) and a pivot value (pivot)
Output: A new independent array of elements, with all elements less than or equal to pivot on left,
        and all other elements (greater than pivot) appear on right

// VALIDATION:
// VALIDATE FOR REAL DATA
if data array is null:
    throw an Illegal Argument Exception - Cannot partition a null array

if pivot is null:
    throw an Illegal Argument Exception - Cannot partition based on a null pivot

// SETUP:
Create variable (count) to track number of elements to place on left side of final array
for each element (elem) in data:
    if elem <= pivot:
        increase count by 1

Create new array (left) with size equal to count
Create variable (leftTrack) to track position within left array

Create new array (right) with size equal to data length - count
Create variable (rightTrack) to track position within right array

// LOGIC:
for each element (elem) in data:
    if elem <= pivot:
        Set left[leftTrack] to elem
        Increase leftTrack by 1
    else:
        Set right[rightTrack] to elem
        Increase rightTrack by 1

Unordered merge left and right arrays (using unorderedMerge action defined in merging.txt) and store in new array
(merged)

// OUTPUT:
Return merged
