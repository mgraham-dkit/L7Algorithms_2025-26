// VALIDATION:
// VALIDATE FOR REAL DATA
if data is null:

// VALIDATE FOR GOOD DATA
if index is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the length of data:
    throw new Index Out Of Bounds Exception (supplied index is outside the boundaries of the array)

// SETUP:
Create variable (deleted) and set to data[index]

// LOGIC:
for each position (i) in data, beginning at index and up to data length  - 1:
    Set data[i] to data[i+1]

Set last position in data to blank

// OUTPUT:
