Action: Delete a value in an int array at a specified position
Input: An array of integers (data) - the array to be deleted from;
        A single integer (index) - the position at which to delete/overwrite
Output: A single integer - the value that was deleted

// VALIDATION:
// VALIDATE FOR REAL DATA
if data is null:
    Throw new illegal argument exception - cannot delete from a null array
// VALIDATE FOR GOOD DATA
if index is less than 0 OR index is greater than or equal to the length of the array:
    Throw new index out of bounds exception - supplied position is outside boundaries of the supplied array

// SETUP:
Create variable (overwritten) and set to data[index]

// LOGIC:
Set data[index] to 0

// OUTPUT:
Return overwritten

Action: Delete the first instance of a specified value in an int array
Input: An array of integers (data) - the array to be deleted from;
        A single integer (value) - the value to be deleted
Output: A boolean - whether the value was deleted

// VALIDATION:
// VALIDATE FOR REAL DATA
if data is null:
    Throw new illegal argument exception - cannot delete from a null array

// SETUP:
Create boolean (overwritten) and set to false

// LOGIC:
for each position (i) in data:
    if data[i] equals value:
        Set data[i] to 0
        Set overwritten to true
        break out of loop

// OUTPUT:
Return overwritten

Action: Delete all instances of a specified value in an int array
Input: An array of integers (data) - the array to be deleted from;
        A single integer (value) - the value to be deleted
Output: A single integer - the number of copies of the value that were deleted

// VALIDATION:
// VALIDATE FOR REAL DATA
if data is null:
    Throw new illegal argument exception - cannot delete from a null array

// SETUP:
Create an integer variable (overwriteCount) and set to 0

// LOGIC:
for each position (i) in data:
    if data[i] equals value:
        Set data[i] to 0
        Increase overwriteCount by 1

// OUTPUT:
Return overwritten
