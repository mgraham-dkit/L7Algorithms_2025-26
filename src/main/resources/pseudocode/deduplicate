Action: Deduplicate an array (keep one copy of every value in supplied array)
Input: An array of elements (data)
Output: A new (independent) array of data containing only one copy of each value in supplied array

// VALIDATION
if data is null:
    throw Illegal Argument Exception (cannot deduplicate a null array)

// SETUP
Create a new array (filtered) with size equal to data
Create a variable (uniqueCount) to track number of elements added to filtered

// LOGIC
for each element (elem) in data:
    Create boolean flag (found) to track if element exists in filtered and set to false
    for each slot (j) in filtered up to uniqueCount:
        if elem equals value in filtered[j]:
            Set found to true
            Halt loop/break out of loop

    if found is false:
        Set filtered[uniqueCount] to elem
        Increase uniqueCount by 1

resize filtered array to uniqueCount size and store in new array (resized)

// OUTPUT
return resized
